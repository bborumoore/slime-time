# slime-time
My second Unity project - a 2D platformer involving size manipulation of the player character

Unfortunately, the code for this game has become jarbled and destroyed, but I did manage to publish it on Unity before completely destroying it.  Please see SlimeTime(https://play.unity.com/mg/2d/slime-time-1).
